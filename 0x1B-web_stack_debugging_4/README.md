exec {'replace': ... }: This is a resource declaration in a configuration management tool. It specifies the execution of a command or script. In this case, the resource is named "replace".

provider => shell: It sets the provider for the exec resource to be the shell. This means that the command will be executed using the shell environment.

command => 'sudo sed -i "s/ULIMIT=\"-n 15\"/ULIMIT=\"-n 4096\"/" /etc/default/nginx': This is the command to be executed by the exec resource. It uses the sed command to replace the value of ULIMIT in the file /etc/default/nginx. It changes the value from "ULIMIT="-n 15" to "ULIMIT="-n 4096". This change likely aims to increase the maximum number of file descriptors that nginx can open, allowing it to handle a higher amount of requests.

exec {'restart': ... }: This is another resource declaration for the execution of a command or script. In this case, the resource is named "restart".

command => 'sudo service nginx restart': The command to be executed by the "restart" resource. It uses the service command to restart the nginx service.
